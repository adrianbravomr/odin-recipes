<h3>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</h3>
<p>Ingredientes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Bread Flour</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
